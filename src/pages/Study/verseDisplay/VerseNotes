Log in to your account (notes won’t be available unless you’re logged in).

Go to the Bible / Read page and select a Bible version, book, and chapter.

Click any verse in the chapter to open the verse range selector.

Choose your Start and End verses (it will always include the verse you clicked).

Click Apply range — the chapter will filter to only the selected verses and the notes modal will open automatically.

Edit the note title (optional) and write your notes in the text area.

Click Submit to save the note for that selected passage.

Click Exit to close the notes modal and continue reading (use Clear range to return to the full chapter).

To view saved notes later, open the separate Notes page (notes are stored and managed there, not on the Bible page).
